There are many reasons why I want to learn code. I think my first reason would be my children. A six and a seven year old so curious about how everything thing is made whether it is entertainment or nature. Mommy has to have the answers. I was finding myself explaining how most things are made by a computer at least once a day.  

They are so smart! Most recently, my daughter said if everything is made by a computer and we have a compter why don't we make a (Fill in the blank)! My son has also caught on in thinking it's genius to make our own games, devices and countless other random tech he can think of throught out the day. Children are cute... Each time I tell them that they must master the little things first like typing and understanding how to use a computer works before they master the big things like making a video game or even a program. 

When I tell them this... It's like i'm speaking to myself the same. I have to master the small things before I can master to bigger projects like a full time job in the industry. I have to believe in myself and push hard to succeed.
